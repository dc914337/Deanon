This project helps to find hidden friends in social network VK(https://vk.com/feed) by finding all related people and cheching their friends(in VK person1 can hide person2 in his friends but person2 will still have person1 visible in his friends).
I'm using graph database NEO4J to store dumped people and their relations such as friendship, likes, comments, posts, followers, etc.
